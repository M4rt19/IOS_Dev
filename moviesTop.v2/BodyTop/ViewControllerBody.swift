            description: "Of course, one of the main types of classic tattoos is traditional, also known as (old school). The oldest style, which appeared at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, is iconic for the entire industry. In fact, the history of modern artistic tattooing began with old school. Old school was made famous by naval sailors who marked important events in their lives with the help of drawings on their bodies. And if before that, tattoos were purely ethnic, then anchors, swallows, hearts and other iconic plots for old school today began to arouse interest: tattoo parlors began to open, and after them, fans of traditions began to gather. Old school tattoos are easy to distinguish from other styles: it is always a thick, saturated outline, conditional shadows and dense shading. What is important and attracts clients is that the (tradition) looks cool and stylish as one small tattoo, but it is from a large number of old school on the body that powerful large-scale plots are formed. Old school does not require detailed development of the composition, and free spaces are easily covered with dots, stars and small drawings like flowers and dashes. So tattoo sketches in the old school style are extremely universal, they always look harmonious and easily fit into any part of the body.",

            description: "The modern answer to old school is an unconventional style. Unlike the classics, the new school style is dominated by bright colors, but the stylization and plots have also changed a lot, and this is noticeable by the deliberate cartoonishness of the images. In new school, there are no frames within the plots, often abstractions and humor prevail, as well as a pile of tattoos with details. As for the application technique, here you can notice sharp, hard and clear contours. New school is always striking, and its contours always have a clear and rich outline, and free spaces on the body are no longer filled with anything. The main plots of the style are women's faces, birds, skulls, crosses, fire, daggers, angels and roses. And you can often see bright graffiti elements or comics, often (acidic) and clearly noticeable from afar.",

            description: "A Chicano origin, one of the youngest and at the same time most popular tattoo styles. Modern tattoo artists working in the realism style create literally masterpieces, bringing the degree of realism to the analogy of a photograph or portrait. Realism as a tattoo style is characterized by high detail, skillful elaboration of shadows, volumes and highlights. There are no restrictions in the plots, but most often the Instagrams of realists are full of tattoos with girls, animals and flowers. Realism loves scale, so this style is often used for sleeves, backs, torsos and even full-scale plots that occupy almost the entire area of ​​the wearer's body. To surprise and shock is the main goal of tattoos in the realism style. Many different techniques are used in realism: delicate contours, thick stripes, smooth shadows and transitions, coloring a large area of ​​the body. Therefore, tattoo equipment is needed that can (pull) large tasks and can work in long sessions. So progressive and innovative tattoo machines, tattoo paint sets, powerful power equipment are a must-have for a realistic tattoo artist.",

            description: "A tattoo style for the bravest. One of the youngest and at the same time spectacular tattoo styles. According to sources, the biomechanics style arose in the 80s of the 20th century thanks to the unusual works of Giger, an artist from Switzerland. In fact, the main idea of ​​the style is to create an imitation of a cyborg from the human body, and the development of computer technology had a greater influence on this. The biomechanics tattoo style is an organic interweaving of pictures of mechanical parts with human skin. Most often, the final tattoo looks like a torn part protruding from the body. Also, biomechanics lovers tattoo chips, motherboards, wires and other elements. In biomechanics, detailing, working with shadows and volumes, and also naturalness are important. This is a technically complex style, so the equipment for its implementation needs to be powerful and productive. As for bioorganics - a sub-style of biomechanics, in which human skin is intertwined not with cyber-themes, but with natural elements. Particularly spectacular are the plots in which torn skin, protruding bones are depicted, and often tattoo artists emphasize them with the help of fiery or icy glow. Biogranika is a dense and bright coloring, a rich color palette and high elaboration of the contour and shadows. By the way, tattoo artists often do biogranika with the help of freehand, so the result is always the personal vision of organics by the tattoo artist.",

            description: " The basis of this style is lines, patterns and figures. Yes, there is not much space for shadows and volumes, but this does not make the style less complex than others. Fine lines and delicate detailing are the main characteristics of graphics, so every little thing matters: distinct shading should be noticeable, and shadows are not created soft. In the tattoo style of graphics, there is no gray color, and black paint is not diluted with water. Graphics are always a rich black color, clear contours and shadows, made using the technique of linear shading. Graphics are often intertwined with engraving, which is where it draws inspiration. Among the subjects, you can find animals, flowers and even human faces - they look simply fantastic in engraving, like museum exhibits. It takes a lot of time to make such tattoos, but what a result!",

            description: "A style known to all: Japanese tattoos have a rich history, which can hardly be called easy. And yet, the criminal past did not prevent this style from becoming iconic and winning the hearts of people around the world. Now bright and large-scale Japanese tattoos can be seen not only on the bodies of the Yakuza, but also on many tattoo lovers around the world. Initially, Japanese tattoos (aka Irezumi) were made with a bamboo stick Tebori, which had needles at the end. Having gone from being banned in Japan and receiving great attention from the Yakuza style, modern Japanese tattoos have little in common with the technique from which they originated. But traditions and meanings are largely observed, so the symbolism of Japanese tattoos is of great importance even now. Most often, Japanese tattoos are dragons, carp, sakura, images of water and many other subjects that have their own symbolism. The East is a delicate matter, so a tattoo artist working in this style must be well-versed not only technically, but also historically. Because the great popularity of Japanese-style tattoos was formed precisely due to the deep meaning embedded in the images, as well as the symbolism of each element.",

            description: "As the name suggests, in the blackwork tattoo style there is no room for colors other than black. And here it is turned up to the maximum: tattoo artists do not spare black pigment and densely paint over arms, legs, neck, torso and other parts of the body. Moreover, in blackwork, it is the scale and density of application that matter, so not every black tattoo can be called blackwork. And this tattoo style is chosen by brave people who love minimalism, but are ready to go far even in it. Most often, tattoo artists combine blackwork with other tattoo styles, most often with dotwork. Thanks to the dense black background, the dots get the necessary contrast and look impressive. Also, tattoo artists often create collaborations between blackwork and ethnic tattoos, as well as neo-tribalism. And of course, it can't be done without a (cover up) (covering tattoos): in this regard, blackwork allows you to partially or completely cover up unsuccessful tattoos or those that have lost the former love of the wearer. Despite the fact that the blackwork style does not contain complex elements, to perform dense black coloring, you need a lot of experience and serious technical skills in tattooing. And large-scale blackwork is primarily an anatomical style, so without developed spatial thinking and the ability to see in scale, even the largest blackwork will not look harmonious.",

Calligraphy, anatomy and the personal vision of the tattoo artist come together to create complex patterns in which the lines change direction and become an interesting artistic technique. In lettering, the choice of font is of great importance. The most common techniques are blackletter or serif fonts, they fit well into the space of the body and become not just an inscription, but a full-fledged drawing. Lettering is an ideal addition to other tattoo styles, be it realism or blackwork, but it acquires a special place and artistic edge in combination with the Chicano style, which looks incredibly stylish. Of course, there is also symbolism here, and everyone puts their own meaning into lettering. Most often, tattoo artists fill in quotes from books, films, and clients’ favorite tracks, but there are no boundaries in this — lettering has long become something more than just catchphrases in Latin.",

            description: "A bright and bold tattoo style, from which the very modern realism was born. Chicano appeared in the 40s in the USA and several decades later became closely associated with criminal Latin American gangs: it was in this environment and prisons that the first Mexican Chicano tattoos began to be made. Even then, images that became traditional in the Chicano style began to take hold: women, skulls, religious symbols and crosses on the fingers. Today, the Chicano tattoo style is no longer associated with its criminal past, but its character can still be called hooligan. Now it is (gangster chic), it is not dangerous and not frightening, but it still has a lot of symbolism. Aesthetics is also of great importance in Chicano, so even the font for lettering is selected with great attention to each serif. Black and white sleeves with skulls, girls and roses, spectacular calligraphy and an emphasis on realism - traditional images remain popular all over the world. A tattoo artist working in the Chicano style must not only have the necessary “skill” to work out realistic portraits, shadows and details, but also respect history, appreciate symbolism and know the specifics of Latin American culture.",

The ornamental tattoo style is a Polynesian style, in which symbolism still comes first. Lace patterns, mandalas and geometric lines line up in a full-fledged pattern, with which you can roam in volume. The stuffed ornamental resembles wood carving, and it always looks very impressive. An important feature of the ornamental tattoo style is the relationship between lines and dots, building the correct geometry. Often this style is added with images of animals, and at this point new symbolism appears. Abstract sketches in a geometric style fit perfectly on any part of the body and look beautiful both on the chest, shoulder and forearm, and on the ankle, back or buttocks. And sleeves in the ornamental style are always an autolike. The main thing is to choose the right size of the tattoo.",
